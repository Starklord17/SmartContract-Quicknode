# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

## Getting familiar with what is ERC721, how to work with hardhat, and use standards contracts.

## Compile

```cmd
npx hardhat compile
```

```if Cannot find module '@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox'

npm i npm install @nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox
```

Hardhat is more powerfull than remixIDE.

## Deploy

```npx hardhat run scripts/deployNFT.js --network goerli```"# SmartContract-Quicknode"
