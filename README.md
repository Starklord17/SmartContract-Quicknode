# SmartContract-Quicknode

## MaxSM [LearnWeb3](https://learnweb3.io/) bounty submission for [Deploying a Smart Contract Using QuickNode's RPC's](https://learnweb3.io/bounties/9bff5d28-e773-4e7d-a32a-1306058af0f1)


>In this project, I built a smart contract with an NFT without an image and another one with a "Hello Web3" using HardHat, JavaScript, and Solidity. I  deployed the smart contract to QuickNode using Ethereum Goerli as my test network.
To complete this task, I throughly reviewed LearnWeb3's Freshman practicals (building a dApp, cryptocurrency, and NFT), as well as QuickNode's documentation and tutorial on building and deploying a smart contract using HardHat.

The steps I took to complete this task include:
1. Installed HardHat and other dependencies, and created a JavaScript project. More info at Hardhat.md
2. Created a Metamask test account for this project, and obtained the private key using the Goerli test network.
3. Requested Goerli Testnet Ether from the [Chainlink](https://faucets.chain.link/) faucet and made sure the transaction was sent to the MetaMask wallet.
4. Set up the [QuickNode endpoint](https://github.com/Starklord17/SmartContract-Quicknode/tree/main/screenshots/endpoint.png).
5. Created the smart contract (NFTee.sol and helloWeb3.sol), deploy.js, hardhat.config.js, and .env file for securing the private key and QuickNode URL.
6. After a successful deployment, confirmed the [deployment of the contract on EtherScan](https://github.com/Starklord17/SmartContract-Quicknode/blob/main/screenshot/etherscan.png).
